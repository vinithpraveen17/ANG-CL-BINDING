  <h2>Two-Way Binding</h2>

  <p>You can find the code for this portion in src/app/components/two-way-binding, where you should only be modifying
    the two-way-binding.component.html file. Two-way binding is the combination of
    both event and property binding.
    Generally, you'll only see two-way binding when working with some form of user input that performs live-updates on
    the
    site, such as autocomplete features, or changing text in multiple places as the user types in an input box.
    Here, the variable inputText1 is changed from live event updates from the input box, and the text of the text box
    is also simultaneously changed via property binding. This is why this is referred to as two-way binding: Property
    binding and event binding are working simultaneously in tandem.

  <!--this is often referred to as 'banana in a box' syntax-->
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="inputText1">
  <p>{{inputText1}}</p>

  <div class="todo-container">
    <p>Now, replicate that behavior for inputText2:</p>
    
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="inputText2">
    <p>{{inputText2}}</p>
  </div>

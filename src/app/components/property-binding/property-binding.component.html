  <h2>Property Binding</h2>

  <p>You can find the code for this portion in src/app/components/property-binding, where you should only be modifying
    the property-binding.component.html file.
    Property binding will be the process of changing a property of an HTML element, such as an image's src
    attribute, the URL of a link, or the tooltip provided when the user hovers over text.</p>

  <p>For instance, here the URL of a link is shown to be obtained from the TypeScript file. This gives us the
    power to dynamically change what site this links to:</p>

  <a [href]="urlLink">link to angular docs</a>

  <div class="todo-container">
    <p>TODO: Try doing the same thing with this image element. The TS file within this component contains variable
      holding
      a
      URL to the Angular logo named ngLogo, so you can display it on this site by binding it to the [src] attribute via
      property binding.</p>

    <img [src]="ngLogo">

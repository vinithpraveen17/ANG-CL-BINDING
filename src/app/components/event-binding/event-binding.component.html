  <h2>Event Binding</h2>

<p>You can find the code for this portion in src/app/components/event-binding, where you should only be modifying
  the event-binding.component.html and event-binding.component.ts files.
  In the component's HTML code, the binding (click)="processClickButton1() has been added to the button 1 element.
  That means that when the (click) event fires, the processClickButton1 method in the Component's TypeScript file
  will run. In this case, property binding is later used to helpfully inform the user that the button has been clicked.
</p>

<button (click)="processClickButton1()">button 1</button>
<p>{{button1ClickedMessage}}</p>

<div class="todo-container">
  <p>TODO: replicate the functionality by introducing event binding to button 2, as well as writing a method within
    the component .ts file to process the clicking of button 2.</p>

  <button (click)="processClickButton2()">button 2</button>
  <p>{{button2ClickedMessage}}</p>
